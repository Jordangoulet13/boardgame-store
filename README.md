# RainCity Games
This is an e-commerce web application built with a Firebase Backend. Also, Stripe was implemented as its payment gateway. For the deployment, I chose Vercel as my cloud service. In this project, users can search for any boardgames, toys and trading cards they like through the filter system. This system also allows filtering by price, category and name. Users can add/remove items to their cart and place orders.
